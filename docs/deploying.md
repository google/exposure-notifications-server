# Exposure Notification Reference Server

## Building and deploying services

This page explains how to build and deploy servers within the Exposure
Notification Reference implementation.

### Before you begin

To build and deploy a service, you need to install and configure the following:

1. Download and install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

    For more information on installation and to set up, see the
    [Cloud SDK Quickstarts](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts).

1. Download and install [Go 1.14.0 or newer](https://golang.org/dl/).

    Make sure the `go/bin/` folder is set in your `PATH` environment variable.
    For more information on installing and configuring Go, see
    [Install the Go tools](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).

1. Enable Go modules and install the `ko` container builder and deployment tool:

    ```console
    GO111MODULE=on
    go get github.com/google/ko/cmd/ko
    ```

1. Configure the `ko` tool using the `setup_ko.sh` configuration file:

    ```console
    source setup_ko.sh
    ```

### Building and deploying

To build and deploy a service:

1. Generate a [Google Cloud Repository](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
   Docker configuration:

    ```console
    gcloud auth configure-docker
    ```

1. Build and deploy the container using the `ko publish` command from the repository's
   root directory.

    For example, to deploy the exposure key server:

    ```console
    ko publish ./cmd/exposure
    ```

You can find a list of services and their corresponding folders below.

### List of services

The Exposure Notification Reference implementation includes multiple services.
Each service's `main` package is located in the `cmd` directory.

| Service | Folder                | Description |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------|
| exposure key server  | cmd/export | Publishes exposure keys |
| federation | cmd/federation | gRPC federation requests listener |
| federation puller | cmd/federation-pull | Pulls federation results from federation partners |
| exposure server | cmd/exposure |  Stores infection keys |
| exposure cleanup | cmd/cleanup-exposure | Deletes old exposure keys |
| export cleanup | cmd/cleanup-export | Deletes old exported files published by the exposure key export service |

### Deploying using Terraform

You can use Terraform to deploy the reference Exposure Notification on Google
Cloud. These instructions make use of the
[Google Cloud Terraform provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google).

1. [Download and install Terraform version 0.12](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
   or newer.

1. [Create a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)

   Make a note of the project ID, you will be needed later. We recommend
   setting it as an environment variable:

   ```console
   export PROJECT_ID="PROJECT-ID"
   ```

1. **(OPTIONAL)** You can use [Cloud Build triggers](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-github-app-triggers)
   to automatically re-deploy when the Exposure Notification Server GitHub
   repository is updated. To set up Cloud Build triggers:

   1. Go to the
   [Connect Repository Cloud Console page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/connect)
   and follow the instructions using GitHub as the source code location
   (Cloud Build GitHub App). You must choose a repository on which you have
   administrator permissions.

   1. Make a note of the repository you have chosen. You must set the
   repository name (for example, 'exposure-notification-server') and owner
   (for example 'google') as variables when running the `terraform apply`
   command.

1. Authenticate with Google Cloud using the `gcloud` command-line tool:

   ```console
   gcloud auth login && gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

   This will open two authentication windows in your web browser.

   You may need to `unset GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as it takes precedence
   over gcloud's login settings.

1. Change to this directory and run `terraform init`.  Terraform will
   automatically download the plugins required to execute this code.

1. Run `terraform apply` to start deployment:

   Without Cloud Build Triggers:

   ```console
   terraform apply \
     -var project=$PROJECT_ID
   ```

   With Cloud Build Triggers:

   ```console
   terraform apply \
     -var project=${PROJECT_ID} \
     -var region="us-central-1" \
     -var use_build_triggers=true \
     -var repo_owner=${YOUR_REPO_OWNER} \
     -var repo_name=${YOUR_REPO_NAME}
   ```

Terraform will begin by creating the service accounts and enabling the services
on Google Cloud that are required to run this server.

1. Initialize or migrate the database.

   To migrate the database, you will want to start the
   [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/quickstart-proxy-test#install-proxy)
   and then run the [`migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
   command.

   ```console
   DB_HOST="localhost"
   DB_PORT="1433"
   DB_USER="notification"
   DB_PASSWORD="YOUR-DB-PASSWORD"
   DB_SSLMODE="disable"
   DB_NAME="main"
   DB_URL="postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}?sslmode=${DB_SSLMODE}"

   migrate -database ${DB_URL} -path ./migrations up
   ```

### Local development and testing example deployment

The default Terraform deployment is a production-ready, high traffic
deployment. For local development and testing, we recommend you use the
following sample deployment:

1. Run `terraform apply` with the following command:

   ```console
   terraform apply \
     -var project=${PROJECT_ID} \
     -var region="us-central-1" \
     -var use_build_triggers=true \
     -var repo_owner=${YOUR_REPO_OWNER} \
     -var repo_name=${YOUR_REPO_NAME} \
     -var cloudsql_tier="db-custom-1-3840" \
     -var cloudsql_disk_size_gb="16"
   ```
