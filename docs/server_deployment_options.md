# Google Exposure Notification Server

## Server deployment options

This document describes possible strategies for building and hosting the
Exposure Notification Server components. You should use this information
explore and compare trade-offs when making hosting decisions.

The Exposure Notifications Server can be deployed in the following
environments:

* Fully self-hosted or on-premises
* Fully managed Google Cloud
* A combination of self-hosted and fully managed

For more details on each
component, see the [Server Functional Requirements](server_functional_requirements.md).

## Server architecture

The Exposure Notification Server has multiple components which can be
categorized as compute and data. To understand deployment scenarios, you should
look at the architecture of the server and data flow between servers and
devices.

![Exposure Notification Server data ingress flow](images/data-ingress.svg "Exposure Notification Server data ingres flow")

![Exposure Notification Server data egress flow](images/data-retrieval.svg "Exposure Notification Server data egress flow")

The Exposure Notification Server compute components have been designed to be stateless,
scalable, and rely on data stored in a shared databased. This makes the compute
components suited to deployment on
[serverless compute platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing).

Serverless platforms can scale down to zero during times of zero usage, which is
likely if the Exposure Notification Server deployment covers a single or small
number of countries. During times of high demand, serverless platforms can
scale to meet demand.

## Hosting infrastructure options

### Data and compute hosted on premises

You can host all components of the Exposure Notification Server on-premises.

![A diagram of the Exposure Notification Server deployed on-premises](images/on_prem.png "Exposure Notification Server on-premises deployment")

Deploying compute and data components on-premises allows you to have complete
control of all components and deploy them in any location by using an
on-premises Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. However, an on-premises
deployment will require you to configure and maintain the underlying
infrastructure, and ensure it is able to meet usage demands.

When the Exposure Notification Server is deployed on-premises, we recommend you
deploy audit and access logging to the data and API endpoints. This is
automatically available in the fully managed, and hybrid deployment scenarios.

### Storing data on-premises and using Google-managed compute

The Exposure Notification Server supports either compute or data components to
be hosted on-premises or on Google Cloud.

![A diagram of data egress with the Exposure Notification Server that has compute components on Google Cloud and data on-premises](images/hybrid_out.png "image_tooltip")

This example deployment has compute components running on Google Cloud
Serverless products, with databases hosted on-premises. Alternatively, you
could use an [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/) cluster to host
compute components on premises, and have the data components hosted on Google
Cloud as a fully managed service.

### Fully hosted on Google Cloud

This example deployment hosts all components of the system on Google Cloud.

![A diagram of the Exposure Notification Server deployed on Google Cloud](images/google_cloud_run.png "Exposure Notification Server deployed on Google Cloud")

By using fully hosted components most of the serviceâ€™s operation can be
delegated to Google Cloud, which will provide audit and access logging of the
data. For example, Cloud SQL will manage the infrastructure for a hosted
PostgreSQL database.

This solution requires hosting within a
[Google Cloud location](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) which may not
exist in a location that permits use for all parts of the Exposure
Notification Server architecture.
