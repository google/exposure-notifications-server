# Key Retrieval Guide

This page explains how to retrieve keys from the server via a mobile application

## Prerequisites

If you haven't started developing a mobile app, please take a look at the
[Android Exposure Notifications Reference App](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-android)

You will need to
[complete the necessary steps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/expo_notif_api)
to use the exposure notifcations API. You should also ensure that you have
taken the steps to comply with the
[Terms of Service](https://blog.google/documents/72/Exposure_Notifications_Service_Additional_Terms.pdf).
For instance, your app may not request any of the following permissions:
  * ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
  * ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
  * ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION
  * BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
