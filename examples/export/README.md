# Working with Export Files

This demonstrates some utilities and commands to help understand the format documented in
the [Exposure Key File Format documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/exposure-key-file-format)
and using the [export protobuf](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-server/blob/master/internal/pb/export/export.proto).

## Generating signing keys

Export files are signed and verified in the Exposure Notification API prior to matching.
Any standard cryptography tools can be used to generate the asymmetric key pair used
to sign the files. The following illustrates how this can be done with
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

To generate the private key used for signing:

```shell
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out private.pem
```

`private.pem` would not be shared. For verification, the corresponding public key
would need to be shared. The public key could be generated as follows. Again,
any standard cryptography tools can be used, including key management services.
This just illustrates one way it can be done, and how the files in the repo were
created.

```shell
$ openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

## Generating an export

There is a utility that can generate either a random export file or
use the JSON format in the publish api call to specify the contents.
The export file in this directory was generated with the keys above
and the `keys.json` file as follows:

```shell
$ go run ./tools/export-generate --signing-key=./examples/export/private.pem --tek-file=./examples/export/keys.json
```

## Inspecting an export

Exports are just zip files whose contents can be examined as follows:

```shell
$ unzip -l testExport-2-records-1-of-1.zip
Archive:  testExport-2-records-1-of-1.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
      135  1980-00-00 00:00   export.bin
      114  1980-00-00 00:00   export.sig
---------                     -------
      249                     2 files
```

The contents of `export.bin` includes a fixed width header in addition to
the serialized proto. It can be decoded at the commandline by skipping the
header with `tail`:

```
$ tail +17c < export.bin | protoc --decode TemporaryExposureKeyExport --proto_path ../../internal/pb/export/ export.proto | head -n 10
start_timestamp: 1588345200
end_timestamp: 1588431600
region: "US"
batch_num: 1
batch_size: 1
signature_infos {
  verification_key_version: "1"
  verification_key_id: "some_id"
  signature_algorithm: "1.2.840.10045.4.3.2"
}
...
```

## Verifying an export

There's a handy utility to extract the raw bytes of the signature from the
SignatureInfo proto in the `export.sig` file. Then you can use any
standard tools to verify the signature.

```shell
$ go run ./tools/unwrap-signature/ --in=export.sig --out=sigRaw
...
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature sigRaw export.bin
Verified OK
```
