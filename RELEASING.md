# Cutting a release

## Generate release notes

This is a diff from the last time a release was generated. Adjust the `start-rev` and filename output as appropriate. The start rev should be the last release tag.

```
release-notes --github-org google --github-repo exposure-notifications-server --required-author="" --start-rev=v0.2.0 --end-rev=main --output=/tmp/relnotes-0.3.0.md --repo-path=/tmp/relnotes-repo --dependencies=true  --branch=main
```

## Update the release notes

Edit the generated relnotes file and add anything that may have been missed. It's also wise to call out
database migrations, possible breaking changes, and new environment variables that are are needed.

## Create a release branch

Ensure that you are on main, that you are up to date (the commit you want to cut the release at). This requires repo admin privelages.

```
git branch release-0.3
git checkout release-0.3
git push --set-upstream upstream release-0.3
```

## Draft a new release on github
